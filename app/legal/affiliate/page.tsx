            </h2>
            <p>
              Our goal is to provide clear, buyer-focused product information. We write content to help readers understand what a product is, how it is positioned, what features it may offer, and what buyers should check before deciding whether to visit a product page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Affiliate relationships may influence which products are available for coverage, but they do not mean that every product is suitable for every visitor.
            </p>
            <p>Our product content may include:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-slate-600">
              <li>Product overviews</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              We aim to avoid unsupported claims, fake reviews, fake ratings, false guarantees, or exaggerated promises. Product experiences, results, and suitability may vary from person to person.

              Some products featured on Official Products Lab may also have dedicated product information pages or product subdomains.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a product review on the main website may include a link such as “View Product Page,” “Check Current Price,” or “Continue to Product Information Page.”
            </p>
            <p>These pages are designed to provide more product-specific information, such as:</p>

            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900">
              A dedicated product information page does not always mean that Official Products Lab is the manufacturer or direct seller of the product. Unless clearly stated, we should not be understood as the official manufacturer, product owner, or direct checkout provider.
